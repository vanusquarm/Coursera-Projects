In **.NET Framework**, `IHttpClientFactory` is not available, so the best approach is to **create a single instance of `HttpClient`** and reuse it throughout your application. Now, why you should create a single instance of httpclient using a singleton pattern or dependency injection is to reduce the number of open connections which can affect performance for large volumes of requests. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

---

### ‚úÖ **Singleton `HttpClient` (Best Practice for .NET Framework 4.8)**
Create a static, lazily initialized `HttpClient` instance:

```csharp
public static class HttpClientSingleton
{
    private static readonly Lazy<HttpClient> _httpClient = new Lazy<HttpClient>(() =>
    {
        var client = new HttpClient();
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("User-Agent", "MyApp");
        return client;
    });

    public static HttpClient Instance => _httpClient.Value;
}
```

### **Usage Example**
```csharp
public class MyService
{
    public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
    {
        var response = await HttpClientSingleton.Instance.GetStringAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
        return response;
    }
}
```

---

### ‚ùå **Anti-Pattern: Creating `HttpClient` in Each Request**
Do **not** create a new instance of `HttpClient` for every request, as it can lead to **socket exhaustion**:
```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
{
    using (var client = new HttpClient()) // ‚ùå BAD PRACTICE
    {
        return await client.GetStringAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
    }
}
```

This will cause performance issues over time.

### ‚úÖ **Alternative: Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Framework**
If you‚Äôre using **ASP.NET Framework 4.8 with Dependency Injection (e.g., using Autofac or Unity)**, register `HttpClient` as a singleton:

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Register in `Global.asax.cs` (or DI Container)**
```csharp
var container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterInstance(new HttpClient());
DependencyResolver.SetResolver(new UnityDependencyResolver(container));
```

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Inject `HttpClient` into Your Service**
```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public MyService(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
    }

    public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
    {
        return await _httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
    }
}
```

---

### üîπ **Final Recommendation**
- ‚úÖ **Use `HttpClientSingleton`** if you‚Äôre not using a DI container.
- ‚úÖ **Use Dependency Injection** if you have a DI setup in your project.
