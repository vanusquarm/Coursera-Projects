Using a **bastion host** or **jump host** is a best practice in network security and architecture, especially when dealing with sensitive or private infrastructure. Here's **why** they are used:

---

### ✅ **1. Enhanced Security**

- **No direct access to internal servers** from the internet.
- Acts as a **controlled entry point**, reducing the attack surface.
- Limits exposure of internal systems to potential threats.

---

### ✅ **2. Access Control & Auditing**

- Centralizes access to internal resources.
- Easier to **monitor, log, and audit** user activity.
- Can enforce **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** and **role-based access**.

---

### ✅ **3. Network Segmentation**

- Helps enforce **network boundaries** between public and private zones.
- Supports **zero-trust architecture** by requiring authentication at each layer.

---

### ✅ **4. Simplified Firewall Rules**

- Instead of opening ports to many internal servers, only the bastion/jump host needs to be exposed.
- Reduces complexity and risk in firewall configurations.

---

### ✅ **5. Temporary & Controlled Access**

- In cloud environments (like Oracle Cloud, AWS, Azure), bastion services often allow **temporary SSH sessions** with **time-limited access**, improving security.

---

### ✅ **6. Compliance Requirements**

- Many security standards (e.g., ISO 27001, PCI-DSS) recommend or require controlled access to sensitive systems.
- Bastion/jump hosts help meet these compliance needs.
