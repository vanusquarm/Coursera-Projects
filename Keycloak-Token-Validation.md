In Keycloak, if you need to **validate tokens presented by different clients in the same realm**, you should use the **realmâ€™s introspection or user info endpoints**, and the best client to use depends on your scenario:

---

## **1. Best Client for Token Validation**
### **Use `realm-management` Client (for Admin-Level Token Validation)**
- The `realm-management` client has privileges to validate tokens across all clients in the realm.
- You can use its **service account credentials** to call the **introspection endpoint** and verify access tokens.

#### **How to Use It:**
1. Assign the `view-users` and `view-clients` roles to the `realm-management` client.
2. Use the client credentials flow to obtain an admin token.
3. Call the **introspection endpoint**:
   ```
   POST /realms/{realm}/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect
   ```
   with the access token to check its validity.

---

### **2. Alternative: Use a Specific Client with `token-introspection` Role**
- If you want a **dedicated client** for validation, create a **confidential client** and grant it the `token-introspection` role.
- This avoids using the `realm-management` client for security reasons.

#### **How to Configure a Custom Client for Validation:**
1. Create a new client (e.g., `token-validator`).
2. Set `Access Type` to **Confidential**.
3. Enable `Service Accounts Enabled`.
4. Go to **Service Account Roles** and assign `view-clients` and `view-users`.
5. Use the **client credentials flow** to obtain a token and validate tokens.

## **3. When to Use Each**
| **Use Case**                              | **Client to Use** |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| Validate tokens issued by any client in the realm | `realm-management` |
| Validate tokens with a dedicated client for security | Custom `token-validator` client |
| A client wants to validate its own tokens only | The client itself |

---

## **4. Example: Token Introspection Request**
Once the appropriate client has been configured:

```http
POST /realms/{realm}/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic {base64(client_id:client_secret)}

token={access_token}
```

This will return a response like:

```json
{
  "active": true,
  "exp": 1712754000,
  "iat": 1712750000,
  "client_id": "some-client",
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "scope": "openid profile email"
}
```
