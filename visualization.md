Prometheus and Grafana (or Elasticsearch and Kibana) are often used together in modern observability stacks, but they serve very different purposes. Here's a breakdown to help you understand how they compare and complement each other:

### 🛠️ Core Purpose

| Feature                  | Prometheus 🧪                                  | Grafana 📊                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Role**         | Monitoring and metrics collection             | Visualization and dashboarding                 |
| **Data Collection**      | Pull-based model from targets/exporters       | Relies on external sources like Prometheus     |
| **Storage**              | Time-series database built-in                 | No native storage; visualizes external data    |
| **Query Language**       | PromQL (powerful, Go-like syntax)             | Uses queries from connected data sources       |
| **Alerting**             | Built-in alert manager                        | Alerting via integrations (e.g., Prometheus)   |
| **Visualization**        | Basic graphs and tables                       | Rich, customizable dashboards and charts       |
| **Log Management**       | Not supported                                 | Supported via Grafana Loki                     |

### 🚀 Strengths

- **Prometheus excels at**:
  - Collecting and storing metrics in real time
  - Defining alert rules and thresholds
  - Querying data with PromQL for deep insights

- **Grafana shines in**:
  - Creating beautiful, interactive dashboards
  - Supporting multiple data sources (Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, etc.)
  - Sharing insights across teams with intuitive UI

### 🤝 How They Work Together

Prometheus collects the data, and Grafana visualizes it. You can connect Grafana to Prometheus as a data source and build dashboards that reflect system health, performance, and trends.
