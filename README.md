### Enable personalized, real-time banking experiences with chatbots using Azure
Machine learning can be used to intercept and handle common, straightforward issues through chat and messaging services, so customers can quickly and independently resolve simple issues that would otherwise have required human intervention. With the chatbot, a customer can simply type in a question and the bot engages to surface the answer.
### Identify the next best action for the customer
Real-time insights that incorporate machine learning tools—such as sentiment analysis—can help organizations assess the likelihood of a deal closing or the level of a customer’s loyalty. Personally-tailored recommendations powered by machine learning can engage and delight customers with information and offers that are relevant to them.
### Capture, prioritize, and route service requests to the correct employee, and improve response times
A busy government organization gets innumerable service requests on an annual basis. Machine learning tools can help to capture incoming service requests, to route them to the correct employee in real-time, to refine prioritization, and improve response times.
