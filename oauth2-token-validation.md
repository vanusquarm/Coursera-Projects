The code you provided looks mostly correct, but it seems that you're missing the authentication scheme in `AddAuthentication()` and some other minor adjustments to ensure proper JWT configuration. Here's how you can improve and ensure the proper setup for JWT Bearer authentication:

### Full Example for JWT Configuration

1. **Add Authentication Scheme**: You need to specify the authentication scheme to be used, which is typically `JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme`.

2. **Ensure you have the correct section for `identitySection`**: Make sure `identitySection` is properly initialized from your configuration settings.

### Example with corrections:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Ensure that you provide the authentication scheme
    services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
        .AddJwtBearer(options =>
        {
            // Assuming you are reading settings from a configuration file
            var identitySection = Configuration.GetSection("IdentityServer");
            var identityUrl = identitySection.GetValue<string>("Url");
            var audience = identitySection.GetValue<string>("Audience");

            // Configure JWT options
            options.Authority = identityUrl; // URL of the identity provider
            options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false; // Set to true in production to enforce HTTPS
            options.Audience = audience; // The audience for which the token is intended
            options.TokenValidationParameters.ValidateAudience = false; // If you want to disable audience validation (optional)

            // Optionally, you can set more options for token validation
            options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
            {
                // Set custom validation parameters if needed
                ValidateIssuer = true,
                ValidateLifetime = true,
                ClockSkew = TimeSpan.Zero // Optional: set the allowable clock skew to 0 for immediate expiration
            };
        });

    // Add other services
    services.AddControllers();
}
```

### Key Changes and Notes:

1. **Authentication Scheme**: The line `AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)` explicitly specifies the authentication scheme for JWT. This is important for proper setup.

2. **Accessing Configuration**: 
    - I've assumed you're reading settings from a configuration file (like `appsettings.json`). In that case, you need to access the `identitySection` from your `Configuration` object.
    - Make sure that your `appsettings.json` file contains the correct configuration section:
  
    ```json
    {
      "IdentityServer": {
        "Url": "https://your-identity-url",
        "Audience": "your-audience"
      }
    }
    ```

3. **TokenValidationParameters**: You can add more parameters like `ValidateIssuer`, `ValidateLifetime`, and `ClockSkew` to customize your validation logic. In this case, `ValidateAudience = false` is set, which means the JWT won't be validated for the audience value. If you want to validate the audience, you can set this to `true`.

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - **RequireHttpsMetadata**: In a production environment, this should be set to `true` to ensure that metadata is retrieved securely over HTTPS.
   - **TokenValidationParameters**: Depending on your requirements, you might want to tweak additional validation parameters like `ValidateIssuer` to ensure tokens are only accepted from a specific issuer.

### Middleware Configuration (in Configure method):

Make sure you are also adding `UseAuthentication` and `UseAuthorization` in your `Configure` method, as these are necessary for the authentication and authorization middleware.

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    // Other middleware
    app.UseAuthentication(); // Add authentication middleware
    app.UseAuthorization();  // Add authorization middleware

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
}
```

### Conclusion:
1. Make sure to set the authentication scheme correctly.
2. Ensure the configuration section is correctly defined in your `appsettings.json`.
3. Add the necessary validation parameters for JWT handling.
4. Don't forget to add `UseAuthentication()` and `UseAuthorization()` in your middleware pipeline.

With these changes, your JWT bearer authentication setup should work correctly! Let me know if you run into any issues.
